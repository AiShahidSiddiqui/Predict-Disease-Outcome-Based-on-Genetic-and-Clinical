# Predict Disease Outcome Based on Genetic and Clinical Data

This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict disease outcomes based on a combination of genetic and clinical features. The dataset includes anonymized patient data with various biomarkers, genetic indicators, and clinical observations.

## 📁 Dataset

**Filename**: `3. Predict Disease Outcome Based on Genetic and Clinical Data.csv`

### Columns Overview:
The dataset contains the following types of features:

- **Genetic Data**: Includes multiple gene expression markers or SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms).
- **Clinical Data**: Includes age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
- **Target Variable**: A column representing the disease outcome (e.g., `Outcome`, `Diagnosis`, or similar).

> Note: A more detailed description of each column can be added once data exploration is complete.
